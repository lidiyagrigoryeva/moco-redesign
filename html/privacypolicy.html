            preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location,
            information about how and when you use our Services, and other

          </p>
          <p>
            Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies

          </p>
          <p>The information we collect includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Log and Usage Data.</strong> Log and usage data is
              service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information
              our servers automatically collect when you access or use our
              Services and which we record in log files. Depending on how you
              interact with us, this log data may include your IP address,
              device information, browser type, and settings and information
              about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time
              stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed,
              searches, and other actions you take such as which features you
              use), device event information (such as system activity, error
              reports (sometimes called "crash dumps"), and hardware
              settings).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Device Data.</strong> We collect device data such as
              information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device

              numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet
              service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and
              system configuration information.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Location Data.</strong> We collect location data such as
              information about your device's location, which can be either
              precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on
              the type and settings of the device you use to access the
              Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to
              collect geolocation data that tells us your current location
              (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to
              collect this information either by refusing access to the
              information or by disabling your Location setting on your
              device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able
              to use certain aspects of the Services.

            transmission over the Internet or information storage technology
            can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or

            third parties will not be able to defeat our security and
            improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
            Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
            transmission of personal information to and from our Services is
