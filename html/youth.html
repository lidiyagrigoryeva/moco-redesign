        <h1>Youth Programs</h1>
        <p>
          Montgomery County Recreation’s Youth Development Team uses a variety
          of means to reach all of the county’s diverse young people. Our
          recreation activities and services allow children and teens to make
          the most of their time outside of school. Through these various
          outlets, we help young people to become healthier, gain leadership
          experience, develop career skills and connect with caring adult role
          models.
        </p>

        <h2>Excel Beyond the Bell</h2>
        <p>
          Excel Beyond the Bell Elementary is a comprehensive, high-quality
          after-school program that provides opportunities for academic and
          recreational enrichment, in an environment that stimulates learning
          and harnesses the power of play. This program has been designed to
          remove barriers to participation and promote pathways to student
          success.
        </p>

        <h2>RecXtra</h2>
        <p>
          RecXtra gives students the opportunity to learn skills that aren’t
          covered during the school day. It gives them the chance to discover
          new opportunities that they might not typically find in their
          community or education. It allows them to meet students with whom
          they normally don’t cross paths, and spend time with teachers
          outside of the academic setting.
        </p>

        <h2>RecZone</h2>
        <p>
          RecZone lets you get away from the pressures of school work, hang
          out with friends, get active, and even get to know some cool adults.
        </p>

        <h2>Soccer4Change</h2>
        <p>
          Soccer4Change is a comprehensive collective approach to soccer
          outreach; blending innovative components from Montgomery County
          Recreation's successful Winter Futsal program and the successful
          outreach strategies from our partnering agencies. This program has
          been designed to eliminate the barriers of participation for our
          middle and high school population and connecting our young people to
          critical developmental assets through soccer.
        </p>

        <h2>TeenWorks</h2>
        <p>
          Volunteering is one of the best ways for young people to push
          themselves out of their comfort zone and experience new things while
          providing valuable contributions to others and their community.
          TeenWorks volunteers are offered an array of opportunities to gain
          experience and build upon their knowledge, skills and abilities.
