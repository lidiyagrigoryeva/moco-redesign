<!-- 
Sass Implementation and Mechanisms Used in Project 3:

1. Sass Preprocessing: 
   - I used Visual Studio Code with the Live Sass Compiler extension to automatically compile my .scss files into .css. 
   This setup streamlines the workflow, allowing for real-time compilation of Sass to CSS as changes are made in the .scss file.

2. Variables:
   - To maintain consistency in styling and simplify changes, I defined a set of Sass variables for colors, font stacks, and breakpoints. 
   For example, $primary-color, $secondary-color, etc., are used throughout the stylesheet to ensure uniformity and ease of updates.

3. Nesting:
   - Sass's nesting capability is utilized for cleaner and more organized code. For example, within the 'nav' selector, 
   I nested the styling for '.hamburger' and '.nav-links', allowing for a more structured and readable format.

4. Media Queries:
   - To achieve a responsive design, I used Sass media queries. Breakpoints were defined as variables ($tablet, $phone) and used 
   within the stylesheet to adjust styles for different screen sizes. This approach simplifies the management of responsive designs.

                    <h2>Preprocessing</h2>
                    <article>
                        <h3>Implementation of Preprocessing (Client-Side vs. Server-Side)</h3>
                        <p>
                            In web development, preprocessing is a critical step in handling data both before it's sent
                            from the client (such as a web browser) to the server, and before the server processes this
                            data.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Client-Side Preprocessing</h4>
                        <p>
                            This occurs within the user's browser. For example, in a web form, preprocessing can involve
                            validating and formatting user input before it's sent to the server. Using JavaScript, you
                            can create functions that check the data's format (like ensuring an email is valid) and
                            clean it up (like trimming extra spaces) as soon as the user submits the form. This step can
                            reduce server load and provide instant feedback to users, enhancing their experience.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Server-Side Preprocessing</h4>
                        <p>
                            After data arrives at the server from the client, it often requires additional processing.
                            This can involve tasks like sanitizing the data to prevent security issues, or transforming
                            it into a format suitable for database storage. For example, in a Node.js environment,
                            middleware can be used for this purpose. Middleware functions inspect and adjust the
                            incoming data before it reaches the main server logic, preparing it for safe and effective
                            processing.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Integrating Client-Side & Server-Side</h4>
                        <p>
                            Effective web applications typically utilize both client-side and server-side preprocessing.
                            The client-side handles immediate tasks like input validation, enhancing responsiveness and
                            user experience. The server-side deals with more complex tasks like data sanitization and
                            transformation, ensuring secure and efficient back-end processing. This division of tasks
                            allows for more optimized and secure web applications.

                    <h3>The Mechanisms of Sass & LESS</h3>
                    <article>
                        <h4>Differences Between Sass & LESS:</h4>
                        <p>
                            Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) and LESS (Leaner Style Sheets) are both CSS
                            pre-processors, which are tools that extend the default capabilities of CSS. They provide
                            mechanisms that allow for more efficient, maintainable, and scalable stylesheet writing.
                            Despite their different syntaxes and features, both Sass and LESS aim to make CSS coding
                            more powerful and easier to work with.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Sass</h4>
                        <p>
                            One of the main features of Sass is the use of variables, which allows you to store values
                            like colors, fonts, or any CSS value and reuse them throughout the stylesheet. This makes it
                            easy to implement theme changes or adjustments. Sass also supports nesting, where you can
                            nest CSS selectors within one another, mirroring the HTML structure. This makes the code
                            cleaner and more readable. Other features include mixins, which are reusable blocks of code,
                            and the ability to define functions and control directives (like loops and conditionals) for
                            more dynamic and complex stylesheets.
                        </p>

                        <h4>LESS</h4>
                        <p>
                            LESS, similar to Sass, extends CSS with dynamic behavior such as variables, mixins,
                            operations, and functions. LESS allows real-time compilation via less.js in the browser,
                            which can be useful for development purposes. Variables in LESS are used in a similar way to
                            Sass, enabling the easy customization and management of styles. Nesting in LESS is also akin
                            to Sass, allowing for a more organized and hierarchical structure in stylesheets. One unique
                            aspect of LESS is its operation feature, which lets you perform mathematical operations
                            right within the CSS.
